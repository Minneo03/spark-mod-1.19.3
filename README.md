# spark-mod-1.19.3

This is a minecraft mod made for the version 1.19.3.

I've always played minecraft and I've always liked the idea of creating a mod for this beloved game. Then I realized that it is definitely in my capabilities to at least create a basic mod, and figured I'd give it a shot.

This mod is going to be centered around mineral collection and creation. The idea will be to find different minerals throughout the lands, and use them as a means to create situational items.

In Vanilla Minecraft there is an easy way to simply use 1 Sword, or 1 set of armor, but I think it is quite repetitive to do that, and there should be some advantages and disadvantages when creating tools or armor using different materials. For example, Diamond/Netherrite Items are simply better than Leather, Gold, Chain, or Iron. There is close to 0 reason to these items once you obtain these better materials. My idea is to create alternatives that have various downsides and upsides, while still keeping the idea of progression. 

-Additions-
Minium - Raw Mineral that will be found everywhere that Iron can be found, but with the same rarity as diamonds.

-Changes-

-Future Additions-
Spark Desert Biome (Name Undecided) - A desert like biome that houses different mob variations. There will be minerals exclusive to this biome, and there will be 1 structure housing plenty of mobs along with an endgame mineral.
Abyss - Dungeon generated in the Spark Desert Biome
Repair Kit/Repairing Workshop - A new way to repair items

-Future Changes-
Enchantments - Completely removed/heavily nerfed (Configureable) - Possibly Reworked
Repairs - Concept of a workbench that you can use to repair items rather than relying on mending or unbreaking enchantments.
Leather Armor - Can be modified using different cloths, and will generally give a speed boost or extra ranged damage.
Gold Armor - Grants a much greater attack power while wearing in return for slowness.
Chain Armor - Grants resistance and vitality
Iron Armor - Probably going to stay the same, though increase durability.
Diamond Armor - Increase in Armor, Heavily Decreased Durability, and grants Resistance.
Netherrite - Slowness 2, Grants Resistance, Greatly increased Armor and Durability, Decreases Ranged Damage significantly and Melee Damage slightly.

Much more - given the time.
